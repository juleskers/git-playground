This is our Awesome GIT playground!

== Assignment one ==
1) Please add your name in the list below!
2) Then save
3) then from the command line, commit with:
   ` git commit -am "I just made my first git commit" `
     '-a' means "add all changes to the list-of-things-to-commit (the 'index')"
     '-m' means "use this as a commit message"
4) check if it worked with `git status` and `git log`, does your commit show up?
5) push your result back to the central repo: ` git push `
